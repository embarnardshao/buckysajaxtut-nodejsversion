This is a Barebones Node.js version source of Bucky's very good Ajax tutorial(Lessons 1-11)

Differences Between Bucky's version and this

--> No IE support. You have to add Bucky's try catch loops for that. 
--> Removed XML processing in favour of plain text. If you want to use the xml version, uncomment out the xml portions in foodstore.js but do make sure server.js serves xml too
--> Responses are not quite so rude. ;)

I'm a beginner to AJAX and I don't know any php. I had some trouble getting it to work and noticed some others did too so I uploaded this.

Thanks.
